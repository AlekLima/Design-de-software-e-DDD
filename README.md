üß† Project Overview
A practice project focused on Software Design Principles and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). applying clean architecture principles, SOLID, and DDD concepts in a backend API structure.

üìÅ Folder Structure (src/)
1. @core/
This is your domain layer ‚Äì the heart of DDD.

entities/
Contains business objects (like Student). Entities hold domain logic and are uniquely identified (by id in this case).

repositories/
Interface definitions. You define what your data layer should do (e.g. StudentsRepository), but not how.

2. application/
This is the use-case layer (application logic, orchestration).

use-cases/ Business workflows live here. For example:

enroll-student.ts: Enrolls a new student.

get-student.ts: Fetches a student by ID.

Each use case handles a specific business rule and uses the repositories to interact with the domain layer.

3. infra/
This is the infrastructure layer ‚Äì it implements the contracts defined in the core.

repositories/in-memory/
In-memory implementations of your repositories (good for testing or dev environments).

4. main.ts
This looks like the entry point ‚Äì here you‚Äôre testing your use cases manually by instantiating the InMemoryStudentsRepository and calling use cases.

‚úÖ What‚Äôs Being Practiced
Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
You're separating concerns cleanly into domain, application, and infrastructure.

SOLID principles
Especially the Dependency Inversion Principle ‚Äì application logic depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

Clean Architecture
Very classic layered approach, which makes the code scalable and testable.
